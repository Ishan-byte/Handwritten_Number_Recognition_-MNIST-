Handwritten Number Image Recognition

    The sole purpose of this applicaiton is only being familiar with Keras API by following a walkthrough course in LinkedIN Learning. It is a very short application that uses Keras as the frontend layer and Tensorflow as its backend layer for all the deep learning processes. 

    I didnot implement any paraller computing by tweaking the GPU as it seems a bit much due to the unavailability of a NVIDEA GPU. As to my knowledge, CUDA toolkit is only available to NVIDEA and I have a AMD GPU.

    Dataset used: MNIST (Handwritten Number Images)

    Two Models:

    1) Convolutional NN's : 

            Accuracy : 98.4 %


    2) Feed Forward NN's : 

            Accuracy : 98.25 %
